What is the meaning of life?,"This question—""What is the meaning of life?""—is central to all Sanātana Dharma philosophies. The answer can be explored from several Sanskrit foundational texts.

### 1. **Bhagavad Gita**

**Context:** In the Bhagavad Gita, Arjuna asks about purpose and action. Krishna's teaching spans several chapters.

**Key verse** (Bhagavad Gita 2.47):
> कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन ।  
> मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि ॥

**Transliteration:**  
karmaṇy-evādhikāras te mā phaleṣu kadācana  
mā karma-phala-hetur bhūr mā te saṅgo 'stv akarmaṇi

**Direct translation:**  
You have the right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of actions. Never consider yourself the cause of the results of your activities, nor be attached to inaction.

**Interpretation:**  
Life's meaning is in action performed without attachment—dharma (dutiful action) is central. The Gita further teaches that through selfless action (karma yoga), wisdom (jnana), and devotion (bhakti), one attains liberation (moksha): freedom from the cycle of birth and death.

### 2. **Upanishads**

**Context:** The Upanishads focus on the realization of the self (Ātman) as non-different from Brahman (the absolute reality).

**Key verse** (Chandogya Upanishad 6.8.7):  
> तत् त्वम् असि ।  
> tat tvam asi  
> ""Thou art That.""

**Translation & Meaning:**  
Your true self (Ātman) is identical with Brahman, the ultimate reality. Life’s highest meaning is to realize one's unity with all existence.

### 3. **Yoga Sutras of Patanjali**

**Key verse (Yoga Sutra 1.2-3):**
> योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः ॥  
> तदा द्रष्टुः स्वरूपेऽवस्थानम् ॥

**Transliteration:**  
yogaś-citta-vṛtti-nirodhaḥ  
tadā draṣṭuḥ svarūpe-'vasthānam

**Translation:**  
Yoga is the control of the modifications of the mind. Then the seer abides in its own true nature.

**Interpretation:**  
Life is fulfilled by attaining steadiness of mind, wherein one realizes their true nature—pure consciousness.

### 4. **Practical Synthesis:**

Taking all together—**Gita (selfless duty), Upanishads (realizing oneness), Yoga Sutras (stillness of mind):**

**Sanātana Dharma's view:**  
The meaning of life is to recognize the divinity within, perform one's duty selflessly, and ultimately realize unity with the absolute reality (Brahman). Through self-knowledge, right action, and discipline, one attains lasting peace and fulfillment.
